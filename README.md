TODO
- use commands API to define shortcuts for copy and paste
- use event pages (and make sure that they're kept alive while the notification is displayed)
- see if execCommand when pasting generates a paste event (http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/clipops/), use that for rich data support

DONE
- add icon to notifications
- default icon for browser action
- change browser action icon when new data is available
- reset browser action icon when notification is manually closed
- handle quota errors
- show options page when first installed, and prompt for profile name to be filled in
- 48x48 and 128x128 icons
- auto-dismiss notifications (add setting for interval)
